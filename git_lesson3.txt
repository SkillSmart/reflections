Question 1: 
"When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?"

  Answer:
    
Question 2: 
"Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?"

	Answer:
		- Because i want to make sure that everything is finalized to a production ready state the moment i make it publicly available. 
		- So i want to have a history of commits that i need while working on the project locally, and be able to clean up all the history before actually pushing it.
